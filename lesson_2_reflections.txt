When you initialise a repository it creates a blank hidden .git folder that will contain the repo.
You need to do it so it will know where to put stuff at a later date.
The staging area gives you an opportunity to prepare files for a commit without doing it.
This allows  you to check for mistakes and change you mind before committing if you so choose.
